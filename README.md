# ElasticSearch-AEM

This repository provides an integration of ElasticSearch into AEM.

Please see my [blog](https://www.dev-eth0.de/blog/2017/01/18/elasticsearch-aem.html) for a detailed introduction and more information.

## Requirements

The ElasticSearch AEM Integration has been tested for AEM >6.1. All required dependencies are included in the `complete` package.

To build this project, you first have to build the [elasticsearch-rest-osgi](https://github.com/deveth0/elasticsearch-rest-osgi) client.
